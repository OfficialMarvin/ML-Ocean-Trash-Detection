After reviewing your code, it appears that you are using a pre-trained model for trash detection in satellite images. You are also using the Maxar API to fetch recent satellite imagery over ocean regions, and you are planning to integrate ocean current data to predict the trajectories of the detected trash clusters.

Based on the provided product details from AWS Marketplace for the GluonCV YOLOv3 Object Detector, here are the instructions to use this pre-trained model for detecting trash on ocean satellite imagery using AWS services:

Set up Amazon S3:
Create an S3 bucket to store your satellite imagery data.
Upload your satellite imagery files (e.g., JPG, PNG, BMP) to the S3 bucket.
Set up Amazon SageMaker:
Create a SageMaker notebook instance or SageMaker Studio instance to develop and test your code.
In your SageMaker notebook/studio, install the required Python packages (e.g., gluoncv, mxnet).
Load the pre-trained model:
Use the SageMaker Python SDK to load the GluonCV YOLOv3 Object Detector model from AWS Marketplace.
python


import sagemaker
from sagemaker.model_metrics import (
    MetricsSource,
    ModelMetrics,
)

model_package_arn = "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-1:865070037744:model-package/gluoncv-yolov3-object-detector-dcd82f9dc4d5a3d8ecd3d8fcc52ce602"
model = sagemaker.model.Model(
    model_data=model_package_arn,
    role=sagemaker.get_execution_role(),
    env={"SAGEMAKER_MODEL_SERVER_WORKERS": "1"},
)
Preprocess and load satellite imagery data:
Write code to fetch satellite imagery data from the desired API or source (e.g., Maxar API, Planet API, etc.).
Preprocess the satellite imagery data into a format compatible with the YOLOv3 model (e.g., convert to JPG, PNG, or BMP).
Load the preprocessed data into a format that can be passed to the SageMaker model for inference (e.g., a list of PIL Image objects or NumPy arrays).
Run inference on the satellite imagery data:
Use the SageMaker Python SDK to create a SageMaker transformer and run inference on the loaded satellite imagery data.
python


from sagemaker.transformer import Transformer

instance_type = "ml.m4.xlarge"
transformer = Transformer(
    model_name="YOLOv3-object-detector",
    instance_type=instance_type,
    instance_count=1,
    model=model,
)

# Run inference on your satellite imagery data
inference_response = transformer.transform(data, content_type="image/jpeg", accept="application/json")
Process the inference results:
The inference response from the YOLOv3 model will contain object detections, including bounding box coordinates and class labels.
Write code to process the inference results and extract the detections related to trash or debris in ocean regions.
You can use the coordinate information to map the detected trash onto a grid or coordinate system of your choice.
Visualize and analyze the results:
Use libraries like Folium or Plotly to visualize the detected trash locations on a map or grid.
Analyze the spatial distribution and potential trajectories of the detected trash using additional data sources (e.g., ocean current data, wind data, etc.).
Deploy and scale:
Once your code is working as expected, you can deploy the YOLOv3 model as a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference or use SageMaker Batch Transform for batch inference on large datasets.
Leverage other AWS services like AWS Batch, AWS Lambda, and AWS Step Functions to orchestrate and scale your trash detection and analysis pipeline.
Note that this is a high-level overview, and you'll need to write additional code to handle data fetching, preprocessing, and post-processing according to your specific requirements. Additionally, you may need to adjust the instance types and configurations based on your dataset size and performance requirements.
